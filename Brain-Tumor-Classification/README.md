Background:
Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain that can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most common non-invasive imaging technique used by radiologists to identify these tumors .
The manual inspection of MRI scans is tedious, thereby to overcome this limitation, deep learning—particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—has become a powerful tool for automating tumor detection and classification.
CNNs can learn spatial and textural patterns from MRI images that correspond to different tumor types (like glioma, meningioma, or pituitary) and distinguish them from healthy tissue.
