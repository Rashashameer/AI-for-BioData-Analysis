Drug Response vs Gene Expression:

Overview:
This project explores how gene expression levels affect a patient’s response to a drug. A small dataset of 15 patients was created with two genes (GeneA and GeneB) and their corresponding drug response values.
Goal:
Identify whether changes in gene activity correlate with the effectiveness of a treatment — a concept central to pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine.
Techniques:
Using Pandas, the dataset was organized and correlation values were computed. A scatter plot was used to visualize how each gene’s expression varies with drug response, and a heatmap was used to show the strength of correlation between variables.
Key observation:
GeneA shows a stronger positive correlation with drug response than GeneB, suggesting it may be a more significant biomarker for predicting treatment effectiveness.
This simple model demonstrates how gene-level data can be analyzed to guide drug development and patient-specific therapies.
